In folder with lambda functions there must be :
* node_modules (npm install)
* all node modlue dependecies used
    - underscore
    - jsonwebtoken
    - bcryptjs instead of bycrip bcs of headers!!!
    - fs
    - moment
    - uuid4
* package.json
* package-lock.json

Add this permision to lambdas 
- chmod a+r * (simply run that into command line where you have yor api)
Bcs if you don't add it you will not be able to read/write into files with lambdas
