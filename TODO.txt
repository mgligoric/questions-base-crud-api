- Keep in mind that DynamoDB fetches data in pages, 
therefore you have to issue the same request more than once 
in the case of multiple pages. You have to use the last evaluated
 key to your next request. If there are a lot of entries, 
 be aware that you should handle the call stack size.

- As mentioned, the attribute included in "KeyConditionExpression" should be your hash key only, matching your base table schema (in this case 'feed_guid'). If you want to query on both 'feed_guid' and 'status
you need to create the table with hash and range key and specify 'status_id' as your range key.
